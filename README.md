# tributeToIqbal
This website is a tribute to Iqbal Masih who fought against child labour.

Iqbal Masih became a debt slave in a carpet factory in Pakistan when he was a child. Five years later he was set free. He gave other children the courage to leave their owners. Iqbal was threatened by the carpet factory owners and was murdered on 16 April 1995. He is a symbol for the struggle against child labor and in 2000, he received the first World’s Children’s Prize (after his death). The prize has another name in memory of Iqbal: the Iqbal Masih Award.
